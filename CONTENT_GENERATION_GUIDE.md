# 🌍 UNIVERSAL CONTENT GENERATION SPEC

> **Purpose:**

## SECTION 1: GLOBAL INSTRUCTION

- **Occasions:** relevant cultural, seasonal, or social trends  
- **Current Events:** locally relevant happenings (festivals, sports, holidays)  
- **Tone:** culturally resonant and authentic for the locale  

Every output must contain:
- A **Title** that feels localized and relevant  
- **Images or visual suggestions** (if applicable to asset type)  
- **Author name and short bio** (appropriate for region)  
- **Cultural or contextual reference** (mention or nod to a local insight, trend, or tradition)
