## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### **1. Context Building**
When content generation is triggered, the system:

```typescript
// Located in: src/components/ProjectDetailLayout.tsx
function buildStructuredContext(prompt, country, contentType) {
  // 1. Map country code to full name
  const countryName = countryNames[country] || country;
  
  // 2. Get regional tone based on country
  const regionalTone = regionalTones[country] || 'Global: Neutral...';
  
  // 3. Build appropriate template based on content type
  if (contentType === 'blog-post') {
    return blogPostTemplate(); // Universal Spec for blogs
  } else if (instagram types...) {
    return socialMediaTemplate(); // Universal Spec for social
  } else if (article...) {
    return articleTemplate(); // Universal Spec for articles
  } else {
    return defaultTemplate(); // Universal Spec fallback
  }
}
```

### **2. Template Structure**
Each template includes:

```markdown
